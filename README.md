## Introduction
Welcome to my repo. This is the guts of my portfolio, I update it constantly to reflect my comprehension of programming and computer science. After many commits and revisions, I am proud to switch this to public and advertise my competency.

## Structure 
The backend server is a build with Python and Flask. Find it at `server/` and find documentation there.
The front end of the website is made with React and Typescript. Navigate to `ui.react/` for more information.


# Serve
NGINX is required to serve the app. Run `sudo apt install nginx`.
Run the `setup.sh` file to configure files which are either ignored or fall outside the project's scope. The script uses the current directory as a reference, so be sure to be in `portfolio/` when you run it.
